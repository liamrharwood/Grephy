## Formal Languages and Computability Project

To run, you can either:

* Build with Maven

   OR

* Run the executable JAR file (Grephy.jar)

To use the JAR file, run the following command:

```
java -jar Grephy.jar [-n NFA-FILE] [-d DFA-FILE] REGEX FILE
```

Test files are located in `test-files` directory and should be run with the regex `test` to see simple match, multiple match, and negative match.
